Website design layout

My website is about a site that helps you get free music or a way to find the music you want.
1. The first page is my home page which gives you the layout of the website and what the purpose of the website is, also it gives you 3 links to different sites that give you music
2. The second page is the page that gives you background about the site 
3. The third page gives you ways of contacting me if there are any problems with the site. By the way the email is a fake one, i did not want to put my real email on my site.
